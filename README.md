# bitmanipulation
Bit manipulation is the process of applying certain logical operations on a given sequence of bits to achieve the desired results. It can reduce the need to loop over a data structure and speed up the coding process as bit manipulations are processed in parallel.
The bits in the representation are indexed from right to left. 
We say that a certain bit is set, if it is one, and cleared if it is zero.
