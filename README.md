# Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation is the process of applying certain logical operations on a given sequence of bits to achieve the desired results. It can reduce the need to loop over a data structure and speed up the coding process as bit manipulations are processed in parallel.
The bits in the representation are indexed from right to left. 
We say that a certain bit is set, if it is one, and cleared if it is zero.
The binary number  (a~k~a~k-1~......a~1~a~0~)~2~ represents the number
	(a_k a_(k-1)…a_1 a_0 )_2=a_k⋅2^k+a_(k-1)⋅2^(k-1)+⋯+a_1⋅2^1+a_0⋅2^0  (in decimal)
