# Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation is the process of applying certain logical operations on a given sequence of bits to achieve the desired results. It can reduce the need to loop over a data structure and speed up the coding process as bit manipulations are processed in parallel.
The bits in the representation are indexed from right to left. 
We say that a certain bit is set, if it is one, and cleared if it is zero.
The binary number â€Š(a<sub>k</sub>a<sub>k-1</sub>....a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>0</sub>)<sub>2</sub> represents the number
	(a<sub>k</sub>a<sub>k-1</sub>....a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>0</sub>)<sub>2</sub>=a<sub>k</sub>.2<sup>k</sup> + a<sub>k-1</sub>.2<sup>k-1</sup> + ... + a<sub>1</sub>.2<sup>1</sup> + a<sub>0</sub>.2<sup>0</sup> (in decimal)
